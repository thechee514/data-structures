# CSC150 - Data Structures Projects and Labs
A collection of CSC150 (Data Structures) projects and labs completed in Winter 2015 at Union College.

## Project 1 - Looking out for Number One
**Assignment**

Create a program that takes a file of statistics as input, computes how many of the numbers have
x as a leading digit for all x 1-9, and then plots a bar graph showing the relative frequency of
each of the digits when they lead off a number. The output of your program should look
something like this:

File:
"sunspot_data.txt"
frequency of the lead digit

## Project 2 - Unfair Solitaire?
**Assignment**

Create a program that simulates playing solitaire. Remember, you're not
building a game to be played by a user. You're simply building a program that will play the game
internally. The output of your program should be the number of times that the computer wins out
of 1000 simulated games. Include the win-rate as a percentage. Then repeat the experiment for
2000 games, 3000 games, and so on up to 10000 games. Thus your program's output will look
something like this (with the questions marks replaced by real numbers):

?/1000 games won = ?%

?/2000 games won = ?%

?/3000 games won = ?%

?/4000 games won = ?%

?/5000 games won = ?%

?/6000 games won = ?%

?/7000 games won = ?%

?/8000 games won = ?%

?/9000 games won = ?%

?/10000 games won = ?%

## Project 3 - Figure Eight
**Assignment**

Create a program that allows 2 or more humans to play Crazy Eights via keyboard input and
System.out for output. 

The game should announce when any player has exactly one card remaining (as a warning to the
other players). The game will end when the computer announces a winner.

## Project 4 - Get in Line, Part I
**Assignment**

Your assignment is to create the public **Sequence** class that will allow you to construct and use
sequence containers. Your **Sequence** class will be limited to storing Strings (your book discusses
how to implement a sequence that can store doubles). I want you to implement your **Sequence**
class using arrays. That is, each instance of a Sequence object should have its own array for
storing the data contained in the sequence. 



## Project 5 - Get in Line, Part II
**Assignment**

Redo Project 4 in its entirety, but this time, use a linked list to hold the data members of a
sequence instead of an array. You must keep the exact same public interface that was given in
Project 4. See Project 4 for the interface and testing code. 

## Project 6 - Addressbook
**Assignment**

In this project, you are going to implement the address book using a linked list. In addition, you
are going to analyze the most important methods in terms of their runtime, and you are going to
compare their runtime performance to the runtimes you could have achieved with an array-based
implementation.

## Project 7 - Analyzing Time Complexity 
**Assignment**

Your task is to deduce the worst-case time complexity of each of the six methods and express it
in Big-O notation.

## Project 8 - We the People (Working with Trees)
**Assignment**

At the end of most textbooks is an index that tells you on what pages you can find certain
keywords. Most modern word processors can automatically create an index for you by scanning
the text, picking out significant words, and keeping track of the pages on which those words
occur. 

Your assignment is to write a program that will automatically create such an index for any given
text file.
