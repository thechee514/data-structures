Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb.
#
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb,
whose fleece was white as snow.
#
Everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go.
#
That little lamb followed Mary everywhere.
#
Like a lost puppy-dog, that lamb was.  Except, of course, 
the lamb wasn't lost and wasn't a puppy-dog.
#
She was only like a puppy in that she followed Mary everywhere.
