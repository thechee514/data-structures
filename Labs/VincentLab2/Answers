1. DrawingBox myBoard; - 
Creates a variable of type DrawingBox.
Main memory has variable myBoard pointing to null.

myBoard = new DrawingBox(); 
Constructs the DrawingBox object with myBoard referencing to the DrawingBox Object with
initialized instance variables.
Main memory has variable myBoard pointing to object DrawingBox.

myBoard.setVisible(true); 
Method which makes the variable myBoard visible.
Main memory has variable myBoard pointing to object DrawingBox, something happens to 
instance variable in DrawingBox as a result of setVisible(true). 

myBoard.drawRect(320,230,120,180);
Draws outline of specified rectangle.
Left and right edges of rectangle are at 320 and 440, respectively.
Top and bottom edges of rectangle are at 230 and 400, respectively. 
Main memory has variable myBoard pointing to object DrawingBox, something happens to 
instance variable in DrawingBox as a result of drawRect(320,230,120,180). 

2. The constructor is invoked in the line myBoard = DrawingBox(), we know it is legal to
use it without any arguments because there in the documentation there is a constructor 
that takes no parameters otherwise known as a default constructor. It can also accept
an argument, it would be type string and it would have constructed a DrawingBox with a 
special title rather than the default title. 

3. drawRect is a method of DrawingBox. The version of drawRect we are using is the
method that takes 4 arguments (int x, int y, int width, int height), there is another 
method which only takes one argument (Rectangle r). We know that the version with 4 
arguments is being used because when we call drawRect we use 4 arguments. The first 
argument x is the coordinate of the left edge of the rectangle,  y is the 
coordinate of the top edge of the rectangle, width represents the width of the rectangle
and height represents the height of the rectangle.
